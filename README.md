# Musicish
___


The overall goal is to have a user be able to add a picture of sheet music and then have the computer be able to display that music on staff paper, and play that music when prompted. The user then should be able to select a key to transpose to, or change something in the music and save the changes, and play the changes upon command.

My first thought was having something like Tessearact to use OCR to detect notes on staff paper when it was presented as a jpg and eventually convert it into an xml language.

The current state of the project is it is still at the beginning. Using music21 and Python, a file can be opened and written as a midi sequence. I plan to create a tkinter gui to display the app. I'm examining different engraving programs. I see where Lilypond can work with abjad and the sh library. I also know it's possible to write music using javascript on web pages. The primary goal of this is to expand my knowledge of coding and to learn how to incorporate music into coding.
